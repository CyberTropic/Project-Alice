## Multiplayer

The main idea is that everyone runs the simulation, the commands are rebroadcasted from the server to the clients and the clients are given the "go" to when to continue the ticks.

Clients are set unpaused, and to the max speed, however their progress is blocked by the server until they receive a command telling them to advance a tick.

The server will receive commands from the clients. The server will then send back the commands that were able to be received. It will then wait for all clients using a semaphore, so that no client should be left behind.

The commands should be sent in chronological order. Clients **will** advance one tick when told so, and then execute the commands afterwards as if the player was doing it. This means that all commands should be properly acknowledged by the client as they occurred chronologically.

### Deterministic reimplementations

The standard C++ and C library provide `sin`, `cos`, and `acos` functions for performing their respective mathematical functions. However the implementation of these vary per platform and library, and since we're trying to provide a cross platform experience we reimplemented the mathematical functions from scratch, into a house-built solution.

- `void internal_check(float v, float err, float lower, float upper)` : Some mathematical functions have precision errors on them, we will however, check for any unreasonable numbers well beyond the boundaries of the function, `err` is the maximum absolute error for the function, `lower` and `upper` represent the lower and upper boundaries of the output. `v` being the value. This function should equate to a no-op on release.

### Notification commands

`notify_player_joins` - Tells the clients that a player has joined, marks the `source` nation as player-controlled.
`notify_player_pick_nation` - Picks a nation, this is useful for example on the lobby where players are switching nations constantly, IF the `source` is invalid (i.e a `dcon::nation_id{}`) then it refers to the current local player nation of the client, this is useful to set the "temporal nation" on the lobby so that clients can be identified by their nation automatically assigned by the server. Otherwise the `source` is the client who requested to pick a nation `target` in `data.nation_pick.target`.

The server will send new clients a `notify_player_joins` for each connected player. It will send a `notify_player_pick_nation` to the client, with an invalid source, telling it what is their "assigned nation".

An assigned nation is a "random" nation that the server will hand out to the client so it can identifiably connect to the server as a nation, and perform commands as such nation.

### Out-of-sync (OOS)

No more oos :D
